Welcome to the Leonard Ata blog. The articles here will be written and maintained by me, Leonard Ata.
So, a brief intro . I am a software developer interested in web technologies and mobile applications. I frequently use various tools like Node.js, React and PHP in my day-to-day activities. I currently work at elitePath. It’s a start-up in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. We train web developers from ground zero up and we have a lot of success stories today. My activities there mostly consist of assisting and training junior developers, full stack web development and management.

Well this is my first blog, I have written before but mostly to a smaller audience and mostly on non-technical topics. But the majority of my writing has always been geared towards different topics on leadership, life, choosing a career and their multiple points of view. The inspiration behind this blog is putting out a road map of resources that other software developers can use and also to document interesting technologies that are relevant to developers and things that I learn and pick up on the way. So ultimately, I’ll be sharing my knowledge and experience on here about software development, life and topics geared to assist professionals.

Well enough of the over serious stuff, the reason for the creation of this blog is to aid and help software developers everywhere who might just be getting started into this career and also, for those who have already begun their careers and may need some help in different topics as they undergo their journey of lifelong learning, like me .

So you’d be here if you’re predominantly a developer who’s actively looking to know what other developers are up to and to read up on views on software and other things in life.

I’ll be posting content regularly and will pretty much update this blog on a weekly basis.

I’ve pretty much been in the position of just starting out in software development, as we all have been, and looking for the resources to use or path to guide us on the journey of becoming software developers. It did not happen overnight but slowly, surely and consistently, it happened. Not slowly though. So you don’t get discouraged from the get-go
 
On every technical post on this blog, I’ll clearly explain steps and sequences and on the non-technical posts, I’ll be open and straightforward on facts and on my opinions on topics around software development.
So yeah, I’m welcoming all tech lovers, software developers and lifelong learners. 
Let’s get started.
